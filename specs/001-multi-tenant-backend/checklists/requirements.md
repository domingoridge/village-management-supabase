# Specification Quality Checklist: Multi-Tenant Backend with RBAC

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All validation criteria have been met. The specification is ready for planning phase.

### Key Strengths

1. **Clear Tenant Isolation**: Specification focuses on multi-tenant security without prescribing technical implementation
2. **Comprehensive RBAC**: Eight roles clearly defined with responsibilities and access patterns
3. **Testable Requirements**: Each functional requirement can be verified independently
4. **Technology-Agnostic Success Criteria**: Metrics focus on outcomes (performance, security, user experience) not implementation
5. **Prioritized User Stories**: P1 stories form a complete MVP (tenant creation, RBAC, data isolation)
6. **Complete Edge Cases**: Covers session management, role transitions, and security scenarios

### Assumptions Documented

- Supabase Auth integration approach
- JWT claim structure
- Tenant context switching mechanism
- Role permission model
- Session management behavior

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan` command to generate implementation plan.
