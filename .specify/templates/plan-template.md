# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with constitution v1.0.0 principles:

### Security & Access Control
- [ ] All database queries enforce Row Level Security (RLS)
- [ ] API endpoints authenticated via Supabase Auth with JWT claims
- [ ] Least privilege principle applied to all data access
- [ ] All external inputs validated using Zod schemas

### Database & Migrations
- [ ] Schema changes implemented via Supabase CLI migrations only
- [ ] Critical business rules implemented as database functions/triggers/RLS
- [ ] Multi-tenancy support in schema design
- [ ] All migrations tested in non-production environments first

### API & Integration
- [ ] API contracts documented (OpenAPI/GraphQL schema)
- [ ] API versioning follows semver
- [ ] Breaking changes include migration guide
- [ ] Edge functions are stateless (delegate persistence to database)

### Code Quality & Testing
- [ ] TypeScript used for all backend/edge function code
- [ ] Integration tests cover critical user flows
- [ ] Database logic (triggers, RPCs) has test coverage
- [ ] Linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier) configured

### Environment & Configuration
- [ ] Environment isolation (local/staging/production) configured
- [ ] No credentials committed (use .env.example + secret managers)
- [ ] Consistent logging strategy for errors/metrics
- [ ] Supabase local development environment used

### Architecture Standards
- [ ] Repository structure follows: /supabase, /src, /tests, /docs
- [ ] Dependencies justified and minimal (prefer Supabase native)
- [ ] Horizontal scaling considerations in design
- [ ] Change management via peer-reviewed PRs

**Complexity Justification**: If any gate fails, document in Complexity Tracking table with rationale.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
